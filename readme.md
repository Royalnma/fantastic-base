State the difference between the Statically typed and dynamicaly typed programming language and give examples; We call a language “statically-typed” if it follows type checking during compilation. So, every detail about the variables and all the data types must be known before we do the compiling process, some of the examples are: Java, C++, C, Fotran e.t.c. while we call a language “dynamically typed” if type checking takes place while the program runs (run-time). In this type of language, there is no need to specify the data type of each variable while writing code. some of the examples are: Python, Javascript, Ruby, Perl, PHP e.t.c.
Differentiate between the dataypes null and undefined; Null indicates the absence of a value for a variable. Undefined indicates the absence of the variable itself.
